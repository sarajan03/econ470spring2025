\noindent 1. How many hospitals filed more than one report in the same year? Show your answer as a line graph of the number of hospitals over time. 


```{r} 
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-plans
#| tbl-cap: Multiple reports
ggplot(streets_with_multiple_reports, aes(x = year, y = num_streets)) +
  geom_line(color = "pink", size = 2) +
  geom_point(color = "hotpink", size = 2) +
  labs(title = "Number of Hospitals Filing More Than One Report Per Year",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Hospital Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```

\newpage 
\noindent 2. After removing/combining multiple reports, how many unique hospital IDs (Medicare provider numbers) exist in the data?

```{r} 

library(scales)
library(ggplot2)

# Violin Plot for Total Charges Distribution (Updated)
ggplot(final.hcris.data, aes(x = as.factor(year), y = tot_charges)) + 
  # Generate the violin plot with customized fill and outline colors
  geom_violin(fill = "#8A2BE2", color = "#006400", alpha = 0.75) +  # Violet fill and dark green outline

  # Apply a log scale to the y-axis and format labels with commas for readability
  scale_y_log10(
    labels = label_comma(scale = 1, accuracy = 0.1)  # Adjusting accuracy for clearer labels
  ) + 
  
  # Add titles, axis labels, and caption with a more descriptive text
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Total Charges Over the Years",
    x = "Year of Report",
    y = "Log of Total Charges",
    caption = "Data Source: HCRIS (Medicare/Medicaid)"
  ) +
  
  # Minimal theme for better aesthetics
  theme_minimal() +
  
  # Adjust the x-axis labels to be angled for better visibility
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 10),  # Rotate x-axis labels
    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 14),  # Increase font size for x-axis title
    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 14),  # Increase font size for y-axis title
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16),  # Center-align and increase font size of the title
    plot.caption = element_text(size = 10)  # Adjusting font size for the caption
  )
```
